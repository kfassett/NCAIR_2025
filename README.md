Documents for presentation at the North Carolina Association for Institutional Research (NCAIR) 2025:
•Presentation
•R Code outlining survey research tools


Presentation Abstract:
This session will focus on how R can be used in Institutional Research. R, an open-source programming language, offers a high degree of flexibility and enables sophisticated data management tasks. Adopting a programming language (i.e., R) can provide notable benefits for any IR office that relies on more time-consuming legacy processes to conduct their work. In this session, presenters from two different institutions will share their experiences integrating R into their daily workflows and the advantages it has brought. They will demonstrate practical scenarios to leverage R for enhancing institutional & survey reporting. Examples will include creating data dictionaries and longitudinal datasets. Additionally, the presenters will highlight commonalities of how each institution uses R as well as some of the challenges encountered. No prior familiarity with R is required, and the session’s content can be applied to other programming languages (e.g., Python, SAS). The presenters will provide a list of free resources for individuals who are interested in learning how to use R.
